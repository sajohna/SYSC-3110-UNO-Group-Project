/**
 * This class represents a player in Uno Flip. Each player has a name, a hand of cards,
 * a score, and a count of how many cards they currently hold. The class provides methods to manage the player's hand,
 * such as adding, removing, drawing, and playing cards. It also allows for updating and resetting the player's score.
 *
 * Data Structure Design:
 * - String name: Holds the player's display name, used for identification in the game UI and logic
 * - ArrayList of Card_Model: A dynamic list that stores the cards currently in the player's hand
 *   ArrayList choosen for:
 *      * structure allows for efficient indexed access (for playing cards by index)
 *      * easy addition/removal as the hand changes during play
 * - int score: Tracks the playerâ€™s total score in the game
 * - int numCards: Keeps track of the number of cards in player's hand
